## Royal Blood

- a basic command prompt game where you create a royal family and a royal inheritance tree is constructed
- use verbs to modify the tree and "play" the game
    - /kill : to remove an inheritor and change the line of succession
    - /add : to add an inheritor
    - /inherit : to change who inherits the crown
- randomly generate a tree and then write a story to a text file
- attributes of a node
    - name
    - parents
    - children
    - age
    - popularity
    - status (dead/alive)
    - inheritor (default : children)
- each node will have a name to symbolise actual royal people kinda
- two similar node names cannot exist; if they do raise ConflictError
- add a queen regent if the inheritor is too young
- add random events to maybe stage a coup or disease or a victory for the king to increase and decrease their popularity
